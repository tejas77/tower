# Tower : A React-Native Device-Motion Example App
a simple example on how to use device motion in react-native application using expo.

## Getting Started
I was looking into the Apple's Compass application which also has the leveling feature. I thought of creating the same application as an example to understand the physics of mobile device motion. After many thoughts, I thought to create an application which will show an illusion of a cylinder tower standing out with a shadow and our motion is the camera view looking at cylinder from different angles.
